## Assignment 5 - FamilyTree via Grphviz
### Sai Teja Sripathi
## Description

 A family tree is  generated using graphviz visualizing tool. Python code is used to generate the graphviz code(dot file). Python code takes CSV file generated from this [website](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/family-tree-generator/lineage.html) as input. The generated family tree shows parent-child, spouse, ancestral and clan relations. Each clan has a unique color.

# Instruction
markup: 1.Install Graphviz on mac or windows for your operating system.
        2.Generate a family tree file form [website](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/family-tree-generator/lineage.html)
        3.family_tree.py takes csv file as input and generates a dot file.
        4.run the dot file on the graphviz to generate a family tree.
        5.save output family tree as a png file
        6.you can modify family_tree.py file for cutomization 


# Output:-



![family_tree](https://github.com/saisri07/4883-software-tools-sripathi/assets/36495909/66260d93-a9f0-47ce-b6c2-a47c5d1ef5f2)
